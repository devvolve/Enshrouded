# Enshrouded
Enshrouded is a short, atmospheric horror experience created for the SPIN Halloween Horror Game Jam 2025. Built in Unreal Engine 5.6.1, the game draws inspiration from analog horror, Resident Evil, and Until Dawn, blending cinematic tension with minimalist creature design and a dark visual tone.
